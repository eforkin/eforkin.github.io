				<h2>About</h2>
				<p class="about_p">
				I am an aspiring software developer at the University of Michigan studying computer science in the School of Literature, Science, and the Arts. I currently work for the Michigan Daily on the Web Team, where I have been assigned to make a Daily sponsored mobile application for U of M students. I mainly work on the front end development, and the app is due to release late January of 2016. I have many interests outside of coding, so here are a few in order to get to know me a little better.

				<h2>Travel</h2>
				<p class="about_p">
					I love travelling and experiencing what different places have to offer, and I have been fortuate enough to make this almost a hobby. I have visited 11 different countries and 13 different states in my life. Hawaii was my favorite state to visit, but in terms of sheer beauty, Alaska definitely wins. As for countries, Austria (I visited Salsburg in particular) was absolutely incredible. These visits may not come any time soon, but I hope to travel to Australia and Norway in the near future.
