								<h3>My Pet Is Cuter</h3>
								<p>Over the summer of 2016, I decided to pick up a new skill and learn React and Meteor. The best way for me to learn is to dive into a project, so I created a mobile app with React and Metoer called My Pet Is Cuter. It allows users to create profiles for their pets, rate other pets, and see the rating of their own pets. This app will help finally determine the age old question of whose pet really is cuter. The app is not fully completed, but I hope to finish it soon.</p>

                <h3>BlueBuy</h3>
                <p>As a member of the Michigan Daily web team, I aided in the ideation and creation of BlueBuy, designed to be a marketplace for University of Michigan students. They would be able to buy and sell tickets, books, and subleases. Unfortunately, this project was discontinued after six months as it was determined that BlueBuy did not/could not relate to the Michigan Daily enough to be a Michigan Daily product.</p>

                <h3>Face Catch</h3>
                <p> As an undergraduate research asssistant for Dr. Sean Ma, my partner and I were responsible for gamifying Attentional Bias Modification Training (ABMT) methods in order to aid individuals with social anxiety. ABMT trains patients to focus their attention away from threatening images and directs their attention to non-threatful stimuli. We developed two games through Unity3D, and I led the "Face Catch" development in which the user must catch a certain percentage of falling happy faces while avoiding to catch the falling sad faces. </p>
